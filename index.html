    <p>The Munchkin, also known as <b>Sausage Cat</b>, is a breed of cat characterized by its very short legs, which are caused by genetic mutation. Compared to many other cat breeds, it is a relatively new breed, documented since 1940s  and officially recognized in 1991.The Munchkin is considered to be the original breed of dwarf cat.</p>

    <p>Much controversy erupted over the breed when it was recognized by <abbr title="The International Cat Association">TICA</abbr> in 1997 with critics voicing concerns over potential health and mobility issues. Many pedigree cat associations around the world have refused to recognize the Munchkin cat due to the welfare of the breed and severity of the health issues, including the <abbr title="Governing Council of the Cat Fancy">GCCF</abbr>. Breeding of Munchkin cats is prohibited by law in several countries due to these genetic health concerns.</p>

    <p>The name "munchkin" derives from writer L. Frank Baum's diminutive inhabitants of Munchkin Country, originating in the 1900 novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>

    <p>Short-legged cats have been documented a number of times around the world since the 1940s. A British veterinary report in 1944 noted four generations of short-legged cats which were similar to normal cats except for the length of the legs. This line disappeared during the Second World War but other short-legged cats were spotted in Russia during 1956 and the United States in the 1970s.</p>

    <p>In 1983, Sandra Hochenedel, a music teacher in Rayville, Louisiana, found two pregnant cats who had been chased under a truck by a dog. She kept one of the cats and named her Blackberry and half of her kittens were born short-legged. Hochenedel gave a short-legged male kitten from one of Blackberry's litters to a friend, Kay LaFrance of Monroe, Louisiana, and she named the kitten Toulouse. It is from <b>Blackberry and Toulouse's litter</b> that today's Munchkin breed is descended.</p>

    <h3>Characteristics</h3>

    <p>The Munchkin has similar characteristics to normal domestic cats, due to their frequent use as outcrosses.</p>

    <ul>
        <li> It is a small to medium-sized cat with a moderate body type and medium-plush coat.</li> 
        <li>Male Munchkins typically weigh between 6 and 9 pounds (2.7 and 4.1 kg) and are usually larger than female Munchkins, which typically weigh between 4 and 8 pounds (1.8 and 3.6 kg).</li>
        <li>The hind legs can be slightly longer than the front which creates a slight rise from the shoulder to the rump. The legs of the Munchkin may be slightly bowed, although excessive bowing is a disqualification in the show ring. Cow-hocked legs are also penalized.</li>
        <li>The Munchkin comes in all coat colors and patterns.</li> 
        <li>It also comes in a long-haired variety, which is shown in a separate Munchkin Longhair category.</li> 
        <li>The short-haired variety has a medium-plush coat while the long-haired has a semi-long silky coat.</li>
    </ul> 

    <p><abbr title="The International Cat Association">TICA</abbr> rules for outcrossing allows the use of any domestic cat that does not already belong to a recognized breed. Similarity to other breeds is grounds for disqualification. Non-standard Munchkins are not allowed to be shown.</p>
